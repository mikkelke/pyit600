# Salus iT600 Device Protocol Notes

This document describes the gateway payload shapes used by
`salus-it600-client`. The Salus gateway does not expose a public stable local
API, so these notes are based on observed UG600 local Wi-Fi payloads.

## Polling Flow

```text
readall
  -> summary payloads with protocol section hints
  -> one deviceid request per supported device family
  -> detailed payloads parsed into library models
  -> internal state dictionaries replaced atomically
  -> optional update callbacks per refreshed device
```

The gateway is sensitive to concurrent local commands, so the client serializes
encrypted requests with one `asyncio.Lock`.

## Device Signatures

| Device family | Readall signature | Detailed parser |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | `sGateway.NetworkLANMAC` | Gateway metadata |
| Climate | `sIT600TH` or `sTherS` | iT600 thermostat, SQ610, FC600 |
| Binary sensor | `sIASZS` or relay model ID | Contact, moisture, smoke, TRV/receiver relay |
| Sensor | `sTempS` | Temperature sensor |
| Switch | `sOnOffS` | Relay switch or outlet |
| Cover | `sLevelS` | Roller shutter/blind level |
| Wiring centre | `sIT600WC` | it600WC fault registers, no valve/relay state |

## Common Fields

Detailed device payloads normally include:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `data.UniID` | Stable device identifier |
| `data.Endpoint` | Endpoint number for multi-endpoint devices |
| `sZDO.DeviceName` | JSON string containing `deviceName` |
| `sZDO.FirmwareVersion` | Device firmware version, when available |
| `sZDOInfo.OnlineStatus_i` | `1` when online, otherwise unavailable |
| `sBasicS.ManufactureName` | Manufacturer, usually `SALUS` |
| `DeviceL.ModelIdentifier_i` | Detailed model identifier |

`sIT600I.LastMessageRSSI_d` (dBm) and `sIT600I.LastMessageLQI_d` (0-255) appear
on several device families, but only for devices the coordinator heard from
directly on that particular poll. They are intermittently absent on otherwise
healthy, online devices; a missing value must not be treated as a fault or
reported as zero.

## Climate Fields

### iT600TH / SQ610

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sIT600TH.LocalTemperature_x100` | Current temperature, divided by 100 |
| `sIT600TH.HeatingSetpoint_x100` | Heating setpoint, divided by 100 |
| `sIT600TH.MinHeatSetpoint_x100` | Minimum setpoint, divided by 100 |
| `sIT600TH.MaxHeatSetpoint_x100` | Maximum setpoint, divided by 100 |
| `sIT600TH.HoldType` | Preset/hold state |
| `sIT600TH.RunningState` | Current heating/cooling action |
| `sIT600TH.SunnySetpoint_x100` | SQ610 humidity, divided by 100 |

### FC600

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sTherS.LocalTemperature_x100` | Current temperature, divided by 100 |
| `sTherS.HeatingSetpoint_x100` | Heating setpoint, divided by 100 |
| `sTherS.CoolingSetpoint_x100` | Cooling setpoint, divided by 100 |
| `sTherS.SystemMode` | Heat/cool/auto mode |
| `sTherS.RunningState` | Idle/heating/cooling action |
| `sComm.HoldType` | Preset/hold state |
| `sFanS.FanMode` | Fan speed |
| `sTherUIS.LockKey` | Child lock state |

## Wiring Centre (it600WC)

The it600WC has no valve/relay state of its own in its payload -- it is a
fault-register bank paired with SQ610-family thermostats on a hydronic
system, and the single point of failure for every zone it serves.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sIT600WC.Error10`..`Error20`, `Error26`..`Error29` | Fault register bank. Meanings are not documented anywhere the client has found; the parser reports them by register name (see `THERMOSTAT_ERROR_CODES` in `salus_it600/const.py`, shared with the thermostat-side Error01-32 codes) |
| `sIT600WC.ErrorCodeWC_d` | Hex-string summary fault code, `"0000"` at baseline. `bool("0000")` is `True` in Python -- check `str(value).strip("0")` instead, the same pattern `parse_climate_binary_sensor_devices` uses for `sComm.DeviceErrorCode` |

## Protocol Enums

Use the enums in `salus_it600.const` rather than raw integers:

| Enum | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `HoldType` | `FOLLOW_SCHEDULE=0`, `TEMPORARY_HOLD=1`, `PERMANENT_HOLD=2`, `AWAY=6`, `STANDBY=7`, `ECO=10` |
| `SystemMode` | `AUTO=1`, `COOL=3`, `HEAT=4`, `EMERGENCY_HEAT=5` |
| `RunningState` | `IDLE=0`, `HEATING=1`, `COOLING=2`, `FAN_COIL_HEATING=33`, `FAN_COIL_COOLING=66` |
| `FanMode` | `OFF=0`, `LOW=1`, `MEDIUM=2`, `HIGH=3`, `AUTO=5` |

`HoldType.TEMPORARY_HOLD` is reported as `Schedule Override` when a thermostat
is already overriding its schedule. It is not advertised as a normal selectable
preset when the device is in follow-schedule, permanent-hold, away, or eco
states.

## Adding Device Support

Use [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow. At the
protocol level, the checklist is:

1. Capture a `main.py --debug` payload from the gateway.
2. Add or update model constants in `salus_it600/device_models.py`.
3. Add or update the parser in the matching `salus_it600/parsers/` module.
4. Register the parser in `poll_status()` or an existing refresh method.
5. Add tests for valid payloads, missing fields, malformed data, and callback
   behavior.
6. Keep write command values in `salus_it600.const` or model-specific constants;
   do not introduce new magic integers inline.
